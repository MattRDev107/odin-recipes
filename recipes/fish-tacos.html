    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Prepare marinated fish: Whisk olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest,
      garlic, honey, seafood seasoning, hot pepper sauce, cumin, chili powder,
      and black pepper together in a bowl until blended. Place tilapia in a
      shallow dish and pour the marinade over the fish; cover the dish with
      plastic wrap and refrigerate for 6 to 8 hours.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Make the dressing: Combine sour cream and adobo sauce in a bowl. Stir in
      lime juice, lime zest, seafood seasoning, cumin, and chili powder. Add
      salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until needed.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set the
      grate 4 inches from the heat.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Remove fish from the marinade, drain off any excess and discard the
      marinade. Grill fish pieces until easily flaked with a fork, turning once,
      about 9 minutes.

      amounts of tomatoes, cabbage, and cilantro; drizzle with dressing.

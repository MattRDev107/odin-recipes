    <p>
      Vegetable stir-fry is a quick and easy dish that involves cooking
      vegetables in a wok or large skillet over high heat with a small amount of
      oil. The vegetables are usually cut into bite-sized pieces and can include
      a variety of different vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, bell peppers,
      mushrooms, onions, and snap peas. The vegetables are typically cooked for
      a few minutes until they are tender-crisp, which means they still have a
      bit of crunch but are no longer raw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stir-fry dishes are often seasoned with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and
      other flavorful ingredients, and can be served as a side dish or as a main
      dish over rice or noodles. The beauty of vegetable stir-fry is that it's
      versatile and can be customized to your taste by adding different
      vegetables, sauces, or proteins such as tofu, chicken, or shrimp. It's a
      healthy and delicious way to get a variety of colorful vegetables into
      your diet.

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
      heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato
      paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1
      teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer,
      covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
      in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold
      water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
      tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degree C).
    </p>
    
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
      baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2
      of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese
      slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4
      cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and
      Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
      with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
      additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
